Importance of (Low) Inertial Effective Mass as Transport Descriptor in Data-driven Thermoelectric Screening - MRS Open Data Challenge 2019

In this work we provide a data-driven analysis on the role of effective mass and its related descriptors i.e. fermi surface complexity factor in high-throughput thermoelectric materials screening. Leveraging on the available datasets and data from Materials Project, we reveal the crucial role of effective mass on electronic transport. We propose that in low inertial effective mass material, any changes in crystal symmetry, band alignment, or doping have a pronounced effect on enhancing the materialâ€™s thermoelectric power factor
